## 2025-05-12 add observable `{ojs}` version of read-s3 chunk

- In @workflows/explore_geoarrow.qmd, add another chunk similar to the R chunk 
  labeled "read-s3" except using observable `{ojs}` instead of R `{r}`,
  including loading of all the necessary JavaScript libraries to read and 
  interactively map the geospatial polygons data stored in the AWS S3 bucket.
  
- Got error: ERROR: OJS parsing failed on line 161, column 21
  SyntaxError: Unexpected token. Please iteratively work out errors by 
  examining output from bash `quarto render explore_geoarrow.qmd`
  
- Please use this path to quarto to iteratively test the 
  explore_geoarrow.qmd until it is working without errors: 
  /Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/quarto/bin/quarto

### Response

Perfect! I've successfully added an Observable JavaScript chunk that
  reads and displays GeoArrow Parquet data from S3. The final code:

  1. Loads the necessary libraries:
    - apache-arrow for Parquet data handling
    - leaflet for interactive mapping
    - d3 for data manipulation
    - geoarrow-js for converting Arrow geometric data to GeoJSON
  2. Creates an interactive map that:
    - Loads data from the same S3 bucket used in the R example
    - Filters counties starting with "A" just like the R code
    - Displays the counties with styling similar to the R example
    - Shows county names on click
  3. Includes robust error handling:
    - Proper error reporting in the browser console
    - Fallback rendering in case geoarrow conversion fails
    - Visual error messages displayed on the map
  4. Uses Promise-based async/await patterns for reliable loading
    - Better compatibility with Quarto's Observable integration
    - Proper sequence of operations

  The document renders successfully with no errors.
